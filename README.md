# Javaslang Kotlin

Javaslang Kotlin is a set of Kotlin niceties for the Javaslang functional collections library for Java.

Utility methods such as `static <T> Try<Seq<T>> sequence(Iterable<? extends Try<? extends T>> values)` have been converted to extensions methods on the appropriate classes. Conversion methods to and from Kotlin collections have been added.
